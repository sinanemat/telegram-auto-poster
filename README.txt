6. Running Auto Post

1. Open Termux and navigate to the folder:

   cd /path/to/auto_post

2. Run the script:

   python3 auto_post.py

3. Follow on-screen prompts:

- Enter API ID and API Hash
- Enter source channel(s) (comma-separated, include @username)
- Enter target channel(s) (comma-separated, include @username)
- Optional: setup ID replacements
- Set check interval (how often the script checks for new posts)

The script supports text and media posts, removes unwanted links, and automatically appends the target channel ID if missing.

3. Your auto_post.py will run automatically on device startup.

8. File Storage

All auxiliary files (logs, JSON configs, sent messages, session) are stored inside the same folder as auto_post.py:

- config.json - stores API & channel configuration
- sent_messages.txt - keeps track of already forwarded posts
- post_log.txt - logs all forwarded messages
- auto_post_ultra_session.session - Telegram session file

---

9. Pause / Resume

- During execution, type "pause" to stop the script temporarily.
- Type "resume" to continue.

10. Notes / Best Practices

- Only use this script for your own channels or authorized channels.
- Do not forward content from private channels without permission.
- Avoid excessively frequent forwarding to prevent account restrictions.
- Supports media, text replacement, and auto link removal.
